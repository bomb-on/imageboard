# PETSCII

"PETSCII" is a gritty 8-bit worship image board with upload and comment functionality. The project was completed in a week's time at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/) with Vue.js being the first framework explored during the course. _Note: The project is not hosted, due to liability concerns._
